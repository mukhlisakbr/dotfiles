# Documentation Rules

## Finding Framework/Library Documentation

When looking for documentation for a framework or library, follow this priority order with Context7 Integration as the top priority:

1. **Context7 Integration** (Top Priority): Use the Context7 MCP server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library when available.

2. **Official Documentation** (Second Priority): Check the official website and documentation. This is typically the most up-to-date and accurate source of information.

3. **Package Repository** (Third Priority): Check the package's repository page (npm, GitHub, etc.) for README files and linked documentation.

4. **Code Exploration** (Fourth Priority): When documentation is lacking, examine the source code and type definitions (if available) to understand the API and usage patterns.

5. **Community Resources** (Fifth Priority): If official documentation is insufficient, look for community resources such as:

   - Official tutorials and guides
   - Stack Overflow questions and answers
   - Blog posts from reputable sources
